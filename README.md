### Hyper‑V vs VirtualBox vs VMware Virtualization: Why the Behavior Is Different

In Windows, activating Hyper‑V (including features like Windows Sandbox, Application Guard, Windows Hypervisor Platform, WSL2, etc.) launches a low-level Hyper‑V hypervisor.
This results in Oracle VirtualBox not being able to launch virtual machines normally – they either do not start at all or operate in a slow mode.
At the same time, VMware Workstation is able to operate even with Hyper‑V enabled.
The hypervisor uses special VT-x or AMD-V instructions to create and manage virtual environments, making virtualization efficient and secure.
